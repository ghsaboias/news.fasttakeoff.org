# News AIWorld Test Page

This is a simple test page for news.aiworld.com.br.

## Deployment

The page is automatically deployed to the server when changes are pushed to the master branch.

To build the project locally:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an `out` directory with the static files ready for deployment.
