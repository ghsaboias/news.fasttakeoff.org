The announcement, made during a press conference at the National Economic Council, outlines several key initiatives including tax system restructuring, infrastructure development programs, and new investment incentives.\n\nThe reform package includes significant changes to corporate tax rates, a new framework for foreign investments, and a $500 billion infrastructure development plan spanning the next decade. Officials emphasized that these measures are designed to boost economic growth while maintaining fiscal responsibility.\n\nMarket analysts have responded positively to the announcement, with early indicators showing increased confidence in the market.
